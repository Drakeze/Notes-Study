# Rust Learning Path

Welcome to the Rust programming language learning journey! This folder contains structured examples, practice exercises, and projects to help you master Rust.

## 🦀 About Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It prevents common programming errors like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and memory leaks through its unique ownership system.

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Fundamentals (Start Here)
1. **Variables & Types** (`fundamentals/variables.rs`)
   - Learn about Rust's type system
   - Understand mutability and immutability
   - Practice with different data types

2. **Functions & Control Flow** (`fundamentals/functions.rs`)
   - Master function syntax and parameters
   - Learn control structures (if, loops, match)
   - Practice pattern matching

3. **Ownership System** (`fundamentals/ownership.rs`) ⭐ **Most Important**
   - Understand ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
   - Learn about references and slices
   - Master memory management without garbage collection

4. **Structs & Enums** (`fundamentals/structs_enums.rs`)
   - Create custom data types
   - Implement methods and associated functions
   - Use enums for type safety

### Phase 2: Advanced Concepts
5. **Traits & Generics** (`advanced/traits.rs`)
   - Define and implement traits
   - Write generic code
   - Understand trait bounds and objects

6. **Error Handling** (`advanced/error_handling.rs`)
   - Master Result and Option types
   - Learn error propagation with `?`
   - Create custom error types

7. **Concurrency** (`advanced/concurrency.rs`)
   - Work with threads and channels
   - Understand shared state and synchronization
   - Learn about async programming

### Phase 3: Practice & Application
8. **Collections** (`practice_code/collections.rs`)
   - Master Vec, HashMap, HashSet
   - Learn when to use different collections
   - Practice data manipulation

9. **Iterators** (`practice_code/iterators.rs`)
   - Understand lazy evaluation
   - Master functional programming patterns
   - Write efficient, readable code

10. **Projects** (`projects/`)
    - Build the calculator for basic concepts
    - Create the todo app for file I/O and CLI
    - Extend projects with your own features

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

1. **Install Rust**: Visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust
2. **Start with fundamentals**: Begin with `fundamentals/variables.rs`
3. **Run examples**: Use `rustc filename.rs` to compile and run
4. **Try projects**: Navigate to project folders and use `cargo run`

## 🛠️ Running the Code

### Single Files
```bash
# Compile and run a single file
rustc fundamentals/variables.rs
./variables

# Or compile and run in one step
rustc fundamentals/variables.rs && ./variables
```

### Projects (with Cargo)
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd projects/calculator

# Run the project
cargo run

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build optimized version
cargo build --release
```

## 📚 Key Rust Concepts to Master

### 🔐 Ownership System
- **Ownership**: Each value has a single owner
- **Borrowing**: References that don't take ownership
- **Lifetimes**: Ensure references are valid

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- **Memory Safety**: No null pointers, buffer overflows
- **Thread Safety**: Data races prevented at compile time
- **Type Safety**: Strong static typing prevents errors

### ⚡ Performance
- **Zero-cost Abstractions**: High-level features with no runtime cost
- **No Garbage Collector**: Predictable performance
- **Efficient Concurrency**: Safe parallelism

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

1. **Beginner**:
   - Implement a number guessing game
   - Create a temperature converter
   - Build a simple word counter

2. **Intermediate**:
   - Extend the calculator with more operations
   - Add features to the todo app
   - Implement a basic web scraper

3. **Advanced**:
   - Build a web server with async Rust
   - Create a command-line tool with clap
   - Implement a simple database
